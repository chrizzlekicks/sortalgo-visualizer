# React Sort Algorithm Visualizer

Little project to visualize standard sorting algorithms with React. Users can choose the size of the array and select the algorithm for sorting. Currently, there are four algorithms to choose from: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort and Count Sort. Some others will follow.

New features like the detailed movement of the bars will follow. Also better styling, better file structure, etc. Project just got bootstrapped yesterday.
